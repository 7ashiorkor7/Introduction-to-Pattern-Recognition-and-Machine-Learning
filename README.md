# Introduction-to-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning
This course gave an introduction to Machine Learning to solve data-driven problems and provided the readiness to study the more advanced methods of machine learning, that are addressed in the advanced courses.

This repository serves as a resource hub for the "Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" course. Here, you'll find all the projects that were undertaken during the course.

The "Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" course provided a fundamental understanding of pattern recognition and machine learning concepts. The projects were on the basis of the following topics:

* Supervised and unsupervised learning
* Feature engineering
* Classification and regression
* Clustering 
* Neural networks 
* Evaluation metrics and model performance assessment
* Real-world applications
